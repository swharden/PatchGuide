## Relationship between Resistance, Current, and Voltage

We have already discussed how neural membranes can pass current (the excitatory or inhibitory flow of ions through ion channels) and have resistance (largely determined by the number of open channels in the membrane). We have also noted that a small excitatory synaptic current (an EPSC) produces a small excitatory swing in voltage (an EPSP). The greater the voltage swing is, the more impactful that current was on the neuron. Ohm’s Law states that the voltage swing of a current transient is directly related to the resistance. **In neuron terms, the same EPSC (current transient, ΔI) will cause a greater EPSP (voltage transient, ΔVm) in cells with high membrane resistance (Rm).** Drugs which change membrane resistance can increase or decrease the effectiveness of synaptic inputs to a cell simply by altering the passive membrane properties (namely Rm) of the post-synaptic neuron.

> ✔️ **Check:** This paragraph may be the most important one in this chapter! Take extra care to ensure you understand it before proceeding. A strong understanding of Ohm’s law and how changes in the passive property Rm can influence the neuron’s response to excitatory and inhibitory currents is a critical point of understanding when designing experiments and critically analyzing data. This concept is demonstrated mathematically on the following page.

## Mathematical Representation of Ohm’s Law

Ohm’s Law states that Voltage (V) is equal to current (I) times resistance (R), and is traditionally written as:

<div class="fs-5 m-3" style="font-family: serif";>
V = I × R
</div>

We can customize Ohm’s Law by substituting abbreviations used to describe neural membrane passive properties:

<div class="fs-5 m-3" style="font-family: serif";>
V<sub>m</sub> = I × R<sub>m</sub>
</div>

Ohm’s law is most useful in describing voltage transients in response to current transients. Therefore:

<div class="fs-5 m-3" style="font-family: serif";>
∆V<sub>m</sub> = ∆I × R<sub>m</sub>
</div>

If we consider ΔVm to be an EPSP, and ΔI to be an EPSC, we can easily see how increasing Rm increases the voltage swing that a fixed EPSC has on the neuron.

> 💡 **Note:** We previously discussed that resting voltage is a function largely of the Na+/K+ ATP pump and KLEAK channels. It is important to note that Ohm’s Law is not used to determine resting voltage! The calculation for resting voltage will be discussed in a future chapter. Instead, Ohm’s Law is best used to describe **voltage transients**, in response to **current transients** (such as synaptic inputs or current injection).
